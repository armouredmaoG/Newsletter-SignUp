## Overview

This is a challenge solution to build a newsletter subscription form and achieving a design close to the specified requirements.
<br/>

- Enables users to submit their email addresses, receive a confirmation message upon successful submission, and view form validation messages for empty fields or incorrect email formats.
- Ensured a responsive design for optimal user experience across various screen sizes. Implemented hover and focus states for interactive elements to enhance usability.

- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
